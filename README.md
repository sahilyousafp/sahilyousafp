# Hi there!!!
# Architect Turned AI Developer

As an **Architect turned AI Developer**, my journey has been driven by a deep curiosity to solve real-world problems and make technology more human and accessible. Over the past year, Ive transitioned from designing buildings to designing intelligent systems and the parallels are more powerful than they seem.

# What I Do

From scripting small automations to deploying AI-driven systems, Ive explored a range of technologies and disciplines that now define my toolkit:

<pre>my_tech_toolkit:dict[str,List[str]] = {
    "Languages": ["Python", "HTML/CSS/JS"],
    "AI/ML": ["Computer Vision", "Machine Learning", "Deep Learning"],
    "Web3": ["Node.js"],
    "Cloud/DevOps": ["GCloud", "N8N"],
    "3D/XR": ["Unity", "Three.js, "Rhino3d"],
    "Embedded": ["Arduino"],
}</pre>

- Python scripting for automation and data manipulation  
- HTML/CSS/JS for UI building and web automation  
- Training and fine-tuning Neural Networks  
- Inferencing with Large Language Models (LLMs)  
- UI/UX design with a research-led approach
- Computational design and modelling

# What I'm Building

For the past 6 months, I've been working with an interdisciplinary team to create a **structural prediction and generation tool** tailored for architects in the **early conceptual stages of design**. The goal is to empower architects with real-time, AI-assisted decision-making capabilities bridging intuition with structural insight.

# Why I Care

My passion lies in bridging the knowledge gap between architecture, engineering, construction (AEC), and modern AI technologies. As machines become better at understanding and responding to us through **natural language**, we are reclaiming something essential:  
**Creativity, reasoning, and emotional intelligence** the very human qualities that define a profession and a purpose.

# Projects That Define My Journey

Here are a few projects that reflect my vision and capabilities:

1. [**Building Analysis Tool (B.A.T)**](https://github.com/sahilyousafp/Building_Analysis_Tool.git)  
   An interactive system that enables designers and policy makers to plan spaces taking the navigation of the visually impaired into consideration.

2. [**Grounded. Structural Solutions**](https://github.com/sahilyousafp/Grounded.-Structural-Solutions.git)  
   A smart system that predicts and proposes structural frameworks from early architectural geometries using AI-based analysis and simulation.

# Lets Connect

Im always open to collaborations that bring together design thinking and technical rigor. Whether youre in AEC or AI or both lets build something intelligent, creative, and impactful together.
