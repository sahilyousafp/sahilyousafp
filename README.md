# Architect Turned AI Developer

As an **Architect turned AI Developer**, my journey has been driven by a deep curiosity to solve real-world problems and make technology more human and accessible. Over the past year, Ive transitioned from designing buildings to designing intelligent systems — and the parallels are more powerful than they seem.

## What I Do

From scripting small automations to deploying AI-driven systems, I’ve explored a range of technologies and disciplines that now define my toolkit:

- Python scripting for automation and data manipulation  
- HTML/CSS/JS for UI building and web automation  
- Training and fine-tuning Neural Networks  
- Inferencing with Large Language Models (LLMs)  
- UI/UX design with a research-led approach  

## What I'm Building

For the past 6 months, I've been working with an interdisciplinary team to create a **structural prediction and generation tool** tailored for architects in the **early conceptual stages of design**. The goal is to empower architects with real-time, AI-assisted decision-making capabilities—bridging intuition with structural insight.

## Why I Care

My passion lies in bridging the knowledge gap between architecture, engineering, construction (AEC), and modern AI technologies. As machines become better at understanding and responding to us through **natural language**, we are reclaiming something essential:  
**Creativity, reasoning, and emotional intelligence** the very human qualities that define a profession and a purpose.

## Projects That Define My Journey

Here are a few projects that reflect my vision and capabilities:

1. [**Building Analysis Tool (B.A.T)**](https://github.com/sahilyousafp/Building_Analysis_Tool.git)  
   An interactive system that enables designers and policy makers to plan spaces taking the navigation of the visually impaired into consideration.

2. [**Grounded. Structural Solutions**](https://github.com/sahilyousafp/Grounded.-Structural-Solutions.git)  
   A smart system that predicts and proposes structural frameworks from early architectural geometries using AI-based analysis and simulation.

## Lets Connect

Im always open to collaborations that bring together design thinking and technical rigor. Whether youre in AEC or AI — or both — lets build something intelligent, creative, and impactful together.
