## Hi there!!!

Being an Architect turned AI Developer, 
I am indulged in solving problems and making technology more accessible. Over the year, I have explored 

1. python scripting 
2. HTML manipulation
3. Training Neural Networks
4. inferencing Large Language Models
5. UI/UX Development and Research

During the pask 6 months, 
I have been working with a team to develop a structural prediction and genereation tool for architects in the early phase of design. 

My interests lay in bridging the knowledge gap between the world of technology and the AEC. With the advancement of technology and AI, the world is interracting with machines in a completely different way. The current and future advents of natural language interraction with machines are a pinnacle in bringing back the core aspects of a profession, things that make us who we are. Creativity, reasoning and emotional intelligence are what sets us apart for the machines.

Here are some of the key projects that define my knowledge base and Experiences: 

1. [https://github.com/sahilyousafp/Building_Analysis_Tool.git](Building Analysis Tool (B.A.T))
2. [https://github.com/sahilyousafp/Grounded.-Structural-Solutions.git](Grounded. Structural Solutions)
